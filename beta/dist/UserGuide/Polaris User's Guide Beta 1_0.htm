      <P class=style1>Polaris (Principle of Least Authority for Real Internet 
      Security) protects you from viruses that you run, either from email 
      attachments you open, macro viruses contained in files you edit, programs 
      you launch, scripts on web pages you visit, or in email you read. This 
      User's Guide describes the Beta 1.0 release of Polaris. Because it is not 
      a fully developed product, there are several places where things can be 
      improved. These future improvements will be noted where appropriate. </P>
      <P class=style1><A class=style2 
      href="http://web.hpl.hp.com/personal/akarp/Polaris%20User's%20Guide%20Beta.htm#contents">Back 
      to Table of Contents</A> </P>
      <H3 class=style1><A name=why>Why Polaris</A></H3>
      <P class=style1>Every program you launch in Windows has the authority to 
      do anything you can do, even if you don't want it done. That's what 
      viruses do. They run in programs you launch and do things that you don't 
      want done. These things include installing spyware, adware, backdoors, and 
      Trojan horses; modifying the system registry; and mailing themselves to 
      email addresses found on your machine. </P>
      <P class=style1>Why is this so? All operating systems in common use today, 
      not just Windows, decide on what a program can do by looking up the 
      identity of the person who launched it. This approach makes sense if we 
      can be sure that the program is operating in that person's best interest, 
      but viruses show that this assumption is not valid. It is this fundamental 
      flaw in existing systems that makes it impossible to protect them from 
      viruses. </P>
      <P class=style1>Polaris takes a different approach to launching programs. 
      Each program is launched as if by a user with the minimum set of 
      authorities the program needs to run. Hence, a virus running in this 
      program can do very little damage. By adhering to the Principle of Least 
      Authority, Polaris reduces your vulnerability to viruses. </P>
      <P class=style1><A class=style2

      <H3 class=style1><A name=how>How Polaris works</A></H3>
      <P class=style1>You don't need to read this section, but knowing how 
      Polaris works may help you build a mental model of what's going on. That 
      mental model may help you identify the cause of a problem and discover 
      your own workaround. </P>
      <P class=style1>Polaris protects you by giving each program you launch 
      only the permissions it needs to do its job. Since it works in a Microsoft 
      environment, it can't rely on changes to the application or the operating 
      system. Instead, Polaris changes the way programs are launched. 
      <BR><BR></P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=361 alt="How Polaris Works" 
      src="Polaris User's Guide Beta 1_0_files/PolarisIn5Minutes.gif" width=600> 
      </CENTER>
      <P class=style1>When you Polarize an application, you are telling the 
      system to launch the program with a program called <B>powercmd.exe</B>. 
      This program uses a variant of the Windows <B>RunAs</B> function that lets 
      you start a program under a different user account. We call the polarized 
      application a <EM>Pet</EM>, and each Pet has a separate user account. For 
      example, a pet you call <B>Excel</B> may have an account named 
      <B>polass7sAaJDp708</B>. The strange name is picked to be unique among all 
      users on your machine, which allows different users to assign the same 
      petname to a given application.</P>
      <P class=style1>Suppose you have Polarized Excel. When you double click on 
      a file with an extension of <B>xls</B>, <B>powercmd</B> makes a copy of 
      the file and starts a program that keeps the copy and the original 
      synchronized. If your file is <B>c:\temp\data.xls</B>, the copy will be 
      created with the file name <B>c:\Documents and 
      Settings\polass7sAaJDp708\Application 
      Data\Hewlett-Packard\Polaris\editables\c\temp\data.xls</B>. 
      <B>Powercmd</B> then starts Excel running as if it were launched by the 
      user <B>polass7sAaJDp708</B>. 
      <P class=style1>Of course, applications need access to more than just the 
      file you're working on. They also need to be able to read their libraries, 
      fonts, <EM>etc</EM>. So, the Pet accounts have an <EM>installation 
      endowment</EM>, the permissions they get every time they start. This 
      endowment includes permission to read your <B>c:\Program Files</B> and 
      <B>c:\Windows</B> directories. The Pet also has read and write permission 
      to its own account's folders, <B>c:\Documents and 
      Settings\polass7sAaJDp708</B> in our example, and its subdirectories. In 
      addition, due to the way the Microsoft Office Suite operates, in this Beta 
      release all Pets have permission to see the name of every file your file 
      system. The result of this installation endowment is that malicious code 
      running in a Pet can read directory and file names, but it can only read 
      the files in its installation endowment and any files you've opened with 
      the Pet. Nevertheless, you may want to be circumspect in the names you 
      choose for files. For example, <B>ATMpin1234</B> is probably not a good 
      file name.</P>
      <P class=style1><A class=style2 
      href="http://web.hpl.hp.com/personal/akarp/Polaris%20User's%20Guide%20Beta.htm#contents">Back

      <H3 class=style1><A name=install>Installation</A></H3>
      <P class=style1>This Beta release of Polaris does not use a standard 
      installer. Instead, you run a set up script that creates some registry 
      entries and two folders. If your userid is <B>alice</B>, these folders are 
      under <B>c:\Documents and Settings\alice\Application 
      Data\Hewlett-Packard\Polaris\</B> and are named <B>requests</B> and 
      <B>editables</B>. You are not given the option of changing the location of 
      these directories. If you already have directories with these names that 
      you are using for some other purpose, you must rename them before 
      installing Polaris. </P>
      <P class=style1>Polaris was developed and tested on Microsoft Windows XP 
      Service Pack 2. We don't guarantee that it will work with this or any 
      other configuration. Some machines are configured in a way that interferes 
      with Polaris. We will try to help you identify the cause of the problem, 
      but we may not succeed.</P>
      <P class=style1>To install Polaris, run <B>setup.bat</B> from your 
      installation CD or shared drive. This script copies the Polaris software 
      to <B>c:\Program Files\Hewlett-Packard\Polaris</B>, adds the shortcul 
      <B>powerwindow.lnk</B> to your startup folder, and starts the PowerWindow. 
      You are now ready to start Polarizing applications. The script also 
      configures your file system so that Office applications can find the files 
      they need. This step can take 10 to 30 minutes depending on how many files 
      you have. Don't panic. Just start the installation when you're ready to 
      leave for lunch. 
      <P class=style1>The most common vector for computer viruses is email 
      attachments. Polaris provides a means to launch attachments that will 
      limit the damage that a virus can do. In this Beta release, you must run 
      <B>setupOutlook.bat</B> to add special buttons to your Outlook windows. 
      You may have to restart Outlook to see them. When you open Outlook, even 
      unpolarized Outlook, you'll see a button that looks like a floppy disk 
      with an arrow coming out of its top. If you mouse over this button, you'll 
      see a tool tip <B>PolarisLaunch</B>. A similar button will appear on each 
      email you open.

      <P><IMG height=189 alt=Endowments 
      src="Polaris User's Guide Beta 1_0_files/PolarisLaunch.jpg" width=393> 
      </P></CENTER>
      <P class=style1><SPAN class=style1>When you want to open an attachment, 
      select the message containing the attachment, and click on the 
      <B>PolarisLaunch</B> button on the Outlook tool bar. If there is only one 
      attachment, it will open. If there is more than one, you will be given the 
      option to select the one you want to open. 
      <P class=style1>If you have created a Pet for the type of attachment, such 
      as <B>Excel</B> for an <B>xls</B> attachment, Polaris will use that Pet. 
      If not, Polaris will launch the attachment in the IceBox, a special 
      account with very few permissions. Many applications won't run in the 
      IceBox, but those that do won't be able to do much harm. If you don't have 
      a Pet for the application, and the attachment won't open in the IceBox, 
      and if you really, Really, REALLY need to open the attachment and you are 
      really, Really, REALLY sure that it's safe, you can double click on the 
      attachment or right click on the attachment and select <B>Open</B>. That's 
      dangerous. A better approach is to save the attachment to disk and open it 
      from there. Be sure to virus scan the file first, but that won't protect 
      you if there's an unrecognized virus in the file. </P>

      <H3 class=style1><A name=uninstall>Uninstalling</A></H3>
      <P class=style1>This Beta release of Polaris does not use a standard 
      uninstaller, nor can you uninstall Polaris from the Control Panel using 
      Add/Remove Programs. If you believe that Polaris is causing you problems, 
      you may want to uninstall it. However, that may not be necessary, since 
      Polaris doesn't interfere with your normal use of appilications.</P>
      <P class=style1>If you have information, such as browser bookmarks, that 
      you want to save, you should move them to a folder in your user account. 
      That's not strictly necessary for the first option below, but you'll 
      quickly forget where you left things if you don't. You can find the 
      account name for the pet by looking at the user <B>User Name</B> in the 
      <B>Processes</B> tab on the <B>Windows Task Manager</B>. If you have more 
      than one Pet for the program, make sure the one you want is the only one 
      that is running. 
      <P class=style1><B>BEWARE</B>. Malicious code may have corrupted those 
      files. Be very careful before moving them out of the Pet account.

      <P class=style1>After installing Polaris, you will have an icon on your 
      desktop labeled <B>Polarizer</B>. Launching this program brings up a 
      window that lets you set up applications to be safe from viruses. Each 
      instance of such a safely <EM>tamed</EM> application is called a 
      <EM>Pet</EM>. <BR><BR></P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=394 alt="Polarizer Window" src="" width=590> </CENTER>
      <P class=style1>There are two lists in the Polarizer window, <B>Existing 
      Pets</B> and <B>Pet Templates for Known Applications</B>. Initially, the 
      list of <B>Existing Pets</B> is empty. You may start by selecting one of 
      the known applications or by typing in the information yourself. The 
      <B>Petname</B> can be anything you like as long as it doesn't contain 
      white space. The Polarizer will create a shortcut for this pet after 
      adding the string <B>Safe</B> to the end of the name you chose. </P>
      <P class=style1>Say that you want to be able to use Excel macros safely. 
      Select <B>Excel</B> from the list of Known Apps. You will see that the 
      <B>Default File Extensions</B> contains <B>xls</B> and <B>xlt</B>. If you 
      don't change this setting, you will be able to launch this Pet by double 
      clicking on the icon for files with either of these extensions. The 
      <B>Path to Executable</B> has been set to point to a likely place to find 
      the program the Pet will run. Simply type over this value or use the 
      <B>Browse</B> button to find the executable. 
      <P class=style1>The <B>Configure</B> and <B>Configure Network 
      Authentication</B> buttons let you change some settings that are described 
      later. You may ignore them for most Windows applications. The <B>Update 
      Existing Pet Endowments</B> button lets you easily correct any mistakes. 
      So, if you decide that you don't want the Excel Pet to launch for files of 
      type <B>xlt</B>, simply select <B>Excel</B> from the list of <B>Exisiting 
      Pets</B>, remove <B>xlt</B> from the list of <B>File extensions</B>, and 
      click this button. You may also use this button to change the any of the 
      options on the <B>Endowments</B> window without repolarizing the 
      application. 
      <P class=style1>If the application you want to Polarize isn't on the list 
      of Known Apps, you can still Polarize it. Just fill in the <B>File 
      Extensions</B> and the <B>Path to Executable</B>. If you don't know the 
      path, then you can browse for it. You'll have to think up your own Petname 
      without any hint from the Polarizer.</P>
      <P class=style1>When the information is to your liking, click the 
      <B>Polarize</B> button. It should take less than 30 seconds to set up your 
      Pet. Be patient. In this Beta release, the icon won't change to an hour 
      glass, but progress is being made. 
      <P class=style1>The polarizer will put an icon on your Desktop with a 
      label <B>ExcelSafe</B> if <B>Excel</B> is the name you've chosen for the 
      Pet. It will also create a user account with a name made up of three 
      parts.

      <UL class=style1>
        <LI>The first part will always be <B>pola</B>. That way all Pets will 
        appear close to each other in a sorted list of user accounts. 
        <LI>The second part is seven characters that should be unique to the 
        user who created the Pet. That way all the Pets created by a given user 
        will appear close to each other in a sorted list of user accounts. 
        <LI>The third part is an integer that is incremented each time you 
        create a Pet. These numbers are never reused unless you uninstall and

      <H4 class=style1>Verifying Installation and Polarization</H4>
      <P class=style1>You are now ready to test the installation. Polarize Excel 
      by selecting it from the <B>Pet Templates for Known Applications</B> on 
      the Polarizer window. Select <B>Excel</B>. If you're using a different 
      version, you'll have to use the <B>Browse</B> button to find the 
      executable. It will probably be in <B>c:\Program Files\Microsoft 
      Office\Officexx\excel.exe</B>, where <B>xx</B> is the version you are 
      using. Next, click <B>Polarize</B>. When the polarization is complete, you 
      should exit the Polarizer. 
      <P class=style1>You can now check that your installation succeeded by 
      running the Polaris demo. The installation procedure for Polaris added a 
      file named <B>killer.xls</B> to your <B>My Documents</B> folder. This 
      spreadsheet uses some time travel technology to calculate, not predict, 
      the value of a stock portfolio 10 years in the future. A lot of people 
      would be very interested in running such a spreadsheet, but it contains a 
      virus that we wrote. 
      <P class=style1>Before you can run the demo, you need to configure your 
      macro security settings. 
      <UL class=style1>
        <LI>Open unpolarized Excel from the <B>Start Menu</B> under <B>All 
        Programs</B>. 
        <LI>If it is running unpolarized, you will not see 
        <B>&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;</B> in the title bar of the Excel window. 
        <LI>Select <B>Tools-Macro-Security</B>. 
        <LI>Set the Security Level to Medium. 
        <LI>Close Excel 
        <LI>Open your Excel Pet using the shortcut the Polarizer put on your

        <LI>Verify that Excel is running polarized by looking for 
        <B>&lt;&lt;Excel&gt;&gt;</B> in the title bar of the Excel window. If 
        you used a different petname, then that name will appear between the 
        angle brackets. 
        <LI>Select <B>Tools-Macro-Security</B>. 
        <LI>Set the Security Level to Low. The text next to that selection 
        recommends against using this setting, but that warning is for Excel not 
        running under Polaris. 
        <LI>Close your Excel Pet. 
        <LI>Make sure you have some shortcuts on your desktop. If you don't have

          <LI>Repeat as necessary. </LI></UL></LI></UL>
      <P class=style1>Now that the one-time setup is complete, you're ready to 
      amaze your friends and neighbors. First, you'll show them what a virus can 
      do if you don't use Polaris. 
      <OL class=style1>
        <LI>Right click on the icon for <B>killer.xls</B> and select

        <LI>A very scary window will appear, but don't worry. Just click 
        <B>Destroy</B>. 
        <LI>The virus we wrote appears to delete all the shortcuts on your

        <LI>Close Excel, and click <B>No</B> when asked if you want to save your 
        changes. </LI></OL>
      <P class=style1>Here's what happened. When you told Windows to open 
      <B>killer.xls</B>, it started Excel and sent the running program the 
      string <B>"killer.xls"</B>. Excel then used that string to open the file. 
      Since the process running Excel could have been given any string, it 
      needed permission to open any file you could open, including all the 
      shortcuts on your Desktop. 
      <P class=style1>Now do the same thing with Polaris. 
      <OL class=style1>
        <LI>Open <B>killer.xls</B>. You can double click on the icon for the 
        file, drag the icon to the shortcut labelled <B>ExcelSafe</B>, or right 
        click on the icon and select <B>OpenSafe</B>. 
        <LI>Point out that you didn't have to deal with an annoying dialog box.

        <LI>The virus is happy, and so are you. </LI></OL>
      <P class=style1>You just saw something pretty amazing. Under Polaris, 
      Excel is more functional, because you can safely use macros, easier to 
      use, because you're not bothered with security dialog boxes, and more 
      secure, because the virus didn't hurt you. Many people would have you 
      believe that you'd have to pick two out of three. 
      <P class=style1>The reason you get all three is that Polaris enforces the 
      Principle of Least Authority at the granularity of individual 
      applications. When Polaris starts the Pet, it starts it with permission to 
      edit none of your files and adds the ability to edit the one file you just 
      selected. That's why the virus didn't eat up your Desktop. Excel didn't 
      need permission to delete your shortcuts, so Polaris didn't give it that 
      permission. 
      <H4 class=style1>Multiple Pets for One Application</H4>
      <P class=style1>In this Beta release, each Pet has permission to read and 
      write any files opened by that Pet. So, if you've opened one spreadsheet 
      received as spam and another spreadsheet containing critical information, 
      a virus running in the spam spreadsheet could destroy the information in 
      the critical file. You have two ways to prevent this attack,

            <LI>Select <B>Kill</B>.

          <LI>Polarize the application with another Petname, say 
          <B>ExcelforSpam</B>. </LI></UL></LI></OL><SPAN class=style1>Only one of 
      them can be set to launch automatically when double clicking on the icon 
      for a file with an extension of <B>xls</B>, but you can always drag the 
      icon for a file to the shortcut for the Pet you want to use. 
      <P class=style1>Another application you might want several Pets for is 
      your browser. You can have one Pet for browsing sites you trust, such as 
      your bank and your stock broker. This Pet can safely remember your 
      passwords, and you can save files you'd like to keep private in the 
      browser's directory. You can have a second Pet for browsing sites you 
      don't trust as much. This Pet won't have access to anything you've put 
      into the first Pet. You'll probably want a third browser Pet if you use 
      your browser to read files. Simply configure this one to launch when you 
      open an HTML file. This way you can use your browser to read files, but 
      scripts on web pages you visit won't have access to them. </P>
      <P class=style1>There's one thing you need to be aware of if you have more 
      than one Pet for an application. Some applications lock a file when they 
      open it. If you try to open it again, you get a read only version. Polaris 
      doesn't lock the file. However, if you open it outside a Pet, a 
      <B>Save</B> of that file in the Pet fails. You'll have to do a 
      <B>SaveAs</B> to save the Pet's copy. The problem is that two Pets that 
      open the same file can both do a <B>Save</B>. That might be a problem, so 
      be careful. At any rate, it's no worse than using an application that 
      doesn't lock the file. 
      <H4 class=style1><A name=repolarize>Re-Polarization</A></H4>
      <P class=style1>There may be times when you want to re-polarize an 
      application. The simplest thing to do is start over from scratch, but that 
      loses any customizations, such as tool bars you added and menus you moved 
      around, that differ from what's on the version of the application that 
      runs in your account. The most common problem is losing your browser 
      Favorites/Bookmarks when you re-polarize. When you click the 
      <B>Polarize</B> button with a Petname that appears in the list of 
      <B>Existing Pets</B>, you'll see the following window. <BR><BR>
      <CENTER><IMG alt="Polarizer Window" 
      src="Polaris User's Guide Beta 1_0_files/repolarize.jpg"> </CENTER>
      <P class=style1>If you didn't mean to use that name, click <B>Cancel</B>, 
      and try again. If you haven't done a lot of customization, you should 
      select <B>Polarize from Scratch</B>. This option is the safest because it 
      creates a brand new user account. That means that any detritus left lying 
      around by malicious code in the Pet account will be deleted. It also means 
      that any settings, such as browser Favorites/Bookmarks or toolbar settings 
      that are specific to the Pet will be lost. You can keep them by clicking 
      <B>Re-Polarize</B>. You'll get a new Pet account, but your settings will 
      be copied from the old one. Now you'll have your configuration, but you 
      may also have settings made by potentially malicious code, such as a home 
      page that you'd rather your children didn't see. How long re-polarizing 
      takes depends on how much customization you've done. It shouldn't take 
      more than a minute or so. 
      <H4 class=style1><A name=netauth>Network Authentication</A></H4>
      <P class=style1>Some sites on the network need to know who you are before 
      you can use them. Windows passes your login information, but not your 
      password, to these programs, so you don't have to type your password over 
      and over. That information is also used when you use a printer on the 
      network that is controlled by an authenticating print server. 
      <P class=style1>Your Pets don't run with your identity, so that doesn't 
      work for polarized applications that access these sites. You can tell 
      Polaris to provide this authentication by clicking <B>Configure Network 
      Authentication</B> on the main Polarizer window, which will bring up the 
      following window. <BR><BR>
      <CENTER><IMG alt="Polarizer Window" 
      src="Polaris User's Guide Beta 1_0_files/netauth.jpg"> </CENTER>
      <P class=style1>You have three options. If you select <B>No 
      Authentication</B>, any password Polaris has remembered for you will be 
      forgotten. <EM>(NB: The following option isn't working right now. We'll 
      remove this warning once it is.)</EM> Selecting <B>Request Password At 
      Boot</B> means that you will have to provide your login password every 
      time the PowerWindow starts. Normally, that will only happen when you 
      login, so it shouldn't be too much of a burden. The password you provide 
      will be stored in an encrypted file if you select <B>Store Password</B>. 
      <P class=style1>You don't have to worry about your password being stolen. 
      Polaris uses EFS, the Windows Encrypted File System, which computes an 
      encryption key based on your login password. Only someone who knows your 
      login password or is running a program as you can decrypt this file. To 
      protect you further, your password is encrypted with itself as the 
      encryption key. Hence, a scan of your disk won't reveal your password. On 
      the other hand, a virus running in your account will be able to get your 
      password. Of course, such a virus has lots of other ways to capture your 
      password and do lots of other nasty stuff. 
      <P class=style1>You will have to return to this window if you change your 
      login password. Of course you don't have to worry about forgetting. All 
      your network authentications will fail until you do. In this Beta release, 
      you will need to restart the PowerWindow after changing your password. 
      Right click on the PowerWindow icon in your system tray and select 
      <B>Exit</B> to close all running Pets and the PowerWindow. Your new 
      password will be in effect when you restart the PowerWindow. 
      <H4 class=style1>Additional Authorities</H4>
      <P class=style1>The Polarizer does a pretty good job setting up the 
      permissions for a Pet. However, there will be times when a Pet will need 
      additional authority. That's what the <B>Endowments</B> are for. Click the 
      <B>Configure</B> button to see what you can do. 
      <CENTER>
      <P><IMG alt=Endowments src=""> </P></CENTER>
      <P class=style1>We'll start at the top of the Endowments window and 
      explain the items one by one. 
      <P class=style1><B>Server Sites to Automatically Authenticate:</B> Every 
      program running in a Window's process has an authentication token. That's 
      how Windows knows what permissions the process has. This token is also 
      passed to network sites so they can know what permissions to grant. If you 
      use a network shared drive, your token tells the machine what files you 
      can read and/or write. Web sites on the Intranet also use the token so you 
      don't have to keep logging in. 
      <P class=style1>When you run a Pet, the process doesn't have your token. 
      Instead, it has a token for the Pet account, which isn't known to other 
      machines. Hence, the Pet doesn't have permission to access any resources 
      on these machines. That's a GOOD THING. It means that a virus running in a 
      Pet can't damage resources on other machines. It can also be inconvenient 
      if you have to keep logging into a few sites over and over. 
      <P class=style1>Fortunately, it's possible to attach the part of your 
      token used for network access to the Pet's token. This section of the 
      <B>Endowments</B> window allows you to specify those servers you want to 
      recognize your pets as you. Doing so can be dangerous because a virus 
      running in the Pet will have all of your authority on these servers and 
      will be able to do anything you can do. However, the convenience may 
      outweigh the risk, particularly if you only have read access to the data 
      on these servers. Just fill in the domain names for each such site in the 
      form <B>server.company.com</B>. <EM>NB: We are having inconsistent results 
      with this feature. We think our corporate servers are doing a hand-off to 
      servers we don't know about. Please let us know how well it works for 
      you.</EM> 
      <P class=style1>You will also need to provide your network authentication 
      so that Polaris can add your network token to the Pet. You do that by 
      clicking on the <A 
      href="http://web.hpl.hp.com/personal/akarp/Polaris%20User's%20Guide%20Beta.htm#netauth"><B>Configure 
      Network Authentication</B></A> button on the main Polarizer window. 
      <P class=style1><B>Additional Applications to run in this Pet:</B> There 
      are times you want to run applications together. A common case is when you 
      want to include a spreadsheet in a document. You can run Microsoft Word in 
      the Excel Pet account. Simply provide the path to the executables you want 
      to run in that account. There's no <B>Browse</B> option in this Beta 
      release, so you'll just have to find the executable and enter the path 
      directly. 
      <P class=style1>When you polarize the application, you'll get a shortcut 
      for the Pet, say <B>ExcelSafe</B>, and one for each application that will 
      run in the pet, say <B>Excel-WordSafe</B>. This convention was chosen to 
      put Pets that run in the same account close to each other in a sorted list 
      of shortcuts. 
      <P class=style1>Note that you may not need to use this option very often. 
      If you are running Excel in a Pet and cause it to open Microsoft Word, 
      Word will open in the Excel Pet account. However, you may find times when 
      that doesn't work. For example, if you polarize your email client, you'll 
      want the program that runs the synchronizer for your PDA to run in that 
      pet. 
      <P class=style1><B>Read-Only:</B> Some applications use collections of 
      files. The most common case is the browser, but it's special, so there's a 
      separate check box elsewhere. A less common case is when you have a 
      document that uses figures stored in some folder. If you open the document 
      in a Pet, it won't have access to those files. Simply fill in the paths to 
      the folders you want the Pet to have read access to. Be careful. The Pet 
      will be able to read any file in the folder and subfolders. 
      <P class=style1><B>Read-Write:</B> Some applications need to be able to 
      modify a collection of files. The most common case is a spreadsheet with 
      links to other files. If you open the spreadsheet in a Pet, it won't have 
      access to those files. Simply fill in the paths to the folders you want 
      the pet to have read/write access to. Be careful. The Pet will be able to 
      modify any file in the folder and subfolders. 
      <P class=style1><B>Command Line Arguments:</B> Some programs allow you to 
      specify runtime parameters in addition to the name of a file. Specify them 
      exactly as you would on a command line. 
      <P class=style1><B>Check Boxes:</B> There are five check boxes on the 
      <B>Endowments</B> window. Each of them deals with a different, commonly 
      occuring special case. 
      <UL>
        <LI class=style1><B>Set as Default Web Browser:</B> When you click on a 
        web link in an email or in a document, Windows launches your default 
        browser. You want that browser to be a Pet, so you check this box when 
        polarizing your browser. Some software installations reset the default 
        to be unpolarized Internet Explorer. You can undo this change by 
        polarizing your browser again. Be sure to save your bookmarks before 
        re-polarizing unless you use the medium risk option explained at <A 
        href="http://web.hpl.hp.com/personal/akarp/Polaris%20User's%20Guide%20Beta.htm#repolarize">Re-Polarization</A> 

        <LI class=style1><B>Set as Default Mail Client:</B> (NB: This option is 
        not yet working. We'll remove this warning once it is.) Many people 
        depend on their email and don't want to risk losing productivity by 
        polarizing their mail client. That's a wise policy, but it can be 
        dangerous. There have been several attacks that get launched when you 
        open or even preview a message. We've found that Outlook can be used 
        effectively in a Pet. However, some functions, such as sending an email 
        from your browser or Microsoft Word won't work unless you check this 
        box. 
        <LI class=style1><B>Allow Read/Write of Windows Temp folders:</B> Some 
        applications make changes in the Windows temp folder, which is usually 
        <B>c:\tmp</B> or <B>c:\temp</B>. You can tell which name to use for sure 
        by opening a command window and typing <B>echo %TEMP%</B>. Such programs 
        violate Microsoft recommendations, but they are not rare. Clicking this 
        box gives the Pet write permission to your temp folder and all its 
        subfolders. Granting this permission may be dangerous if you store 
        install programs in this folder. Malicious software running in a pet 
        with this permission could replace one of those programs with a Trojan 
        Horse that could end up running with administrator privileges. 
        <LI class=style1><B>Allow editing the application execution folder:</B> 
        Some applications make changes in the folder containing the executable 
        of the program being run, which is usually in <B>c:\Program Files</B>. 
        Such programs violate Microsoft recommendations, but they are the 
        primary reason you need to run with administrator privileges to get your 
        job done. Clicking this box gives the Pet write permission to the folder 
        containing the executable program and all its subfolders. This folder is 
        the one in the path name you specified in the main Polarizer window. 
        Granting this permission is dangerous, albeit far less dangerous than 
        granting write permission to all of <B>c:\Program Files</B>, but it's 
        the best you can do if you want to run the program. 
        <LI class=style1><B>Read Only With Links:</B> Some programs need access 
        to other files in the folder of the file being used and files in its 
        subfolders. We say these files are <B>linked</B> to the file you open. 
        The primary example is a browser Pet used to display files stored on 
        your disk. The graphics for the web page are often stored in a 
        subdirectory with a name related to the name of your file. So, if your 
        file is named <B>c:\My Documents\myPage.htm</B>, its graphics are most 
        likely in <B>c:\My Documents\myPage_files</B>. If you simply open a 
        browser Pet to read the file, you won't see the graphics because the Pet 
        won't have permission to read files in the subdirectory. Normally, 
        Polaris makes a copy of a file when it is being edited by a Pet. That 
        would require copying an entire folder hierarchy for a web page to be 
        viewed properly. However, a browser doesn't modify the file, so Polaris 
        avoids this overhead by granting the Pet read permission to folder 
        containing the file and its subfolders. Of course, if the person opening 
        the file doesn't have authority to grant this permission, such as when 
        the file is on a network share, then Polaris does make a copy. 
        <LI class=style1><B>Grant Full Network Credentials:</B> Selecting this 
        option is equivalent to granting this Pet access to everything you can 
        do on the network. A virus running in this Pet's account won't be able 
        to do much harm to your machine, but it might be able to do a lot of 
        damage to other machines you access. Be very careful which Pets get this 
        endowment. 
        <LI class=style1><B>Do Not Shut Down App When Windows All Closed:</B> 
        Normally, Polaris cleans up the Pet account when last visible window 
        running in the Pet is closed. Polaris kills all processes running in 
        that Pet, which prevents a virus from staring a long running program. 
        Polaris also shuts down the file synchronizers and deletes the Pet's 
        copies of any files you opened. That relieves you of worrying what data 
        a virus running in the Pet might see. Unfortunately, this cleanup closes 
        service routines that you may want to leave running. Check this box to 
        bypass the cleanup. If you do need to force a clean up, you can right 
        click on the <B>PowerWindow</B> icon in your system tray, mouse over 
        <B>Kill</B>, and select the Pet you want closed. </LI></UL>

      <H3 class=style1><A name=using>Using Polarized applications</A></H3>
      <P class=style1>You use Polarized applications exactly as you would any 
      other program (except you can't drag/drop between Pets). Either launch the 
      program from the shortcut, drag a document onto the shortcut, or double 
      click on the icon for a file with the appropriate extension. 
      <P class=style1>Your Pet will take a few additional secconds to start the 
      first time you use a Pet after a reboot or when the Pet hasn't been used 
      for a long time. Don't panic. Windows has to load the Pet's account 
      information into the registry. Microsoft didn't optimize that path because 
      they assumed it would only be needed at login. Most applications start in 
      10 seconds or less. However, we have seen delays as long as 30 seconds if 
      a disk intensive program, such as a virus scanner, is running. Once the 
      registry information is loaded, subsequent launches of the application 
      will not incur any additional delay. 
      <P class=style1>Polaris doesn't interact with your program in any way once 
      it is running except for accessing other files. Any time you need to 
      designate a file, such as with <B>Open</B> or <B>SaveAs</B>, you will see 
      a file dialog box presented by Polaris. Because of the way this Beta 
      release operates, you may see another dialog box flash momentarily on your 
      screen before the Polaris file dialog opens and just after it closes. 
      Also, in this Beta release the Polaris file dialog box may sometimes be 
      under another window. Often, clicking the icon for the Pet in the task bar 
      will make the dialog visible. If that doesn't work, hitting <B>ESC</B> 
      cancels the request and returns control to the application. 
      <P class=style1>There will also be times when you see two dialog boxes. 
      The one labeled <B>&lt;&lt;petname&gt;&gt; Open</B>, where <B>petname</B> 
      is the name of the Pet requesting access to the file, is running with the 
      Pet's permissions. The one labeled <B>Open for &lt;&lt;petname&gt;&gt;</B> 
      is the one you want to use since it has all your permissions. This label 
      is very important. A file dialog box from an unpolarized application has a 
      title <B>Open</B>, which gives you no indication of what application is 
      requesting access. With Polaris, you know exactly which Pet will be 
      getting access to the file. 
      <P class=style1>Sometimes a failure occurs that might cause a loss of 
      data, such as when you close the PowerWindow while a Pet is open. In such 
      cases, Polaris saves the version from the Pet account area in a folder on 
      your Desktop named <B>PolarisRecover</B>. You'll have to figure out if the 
      version in that folder is the one you want. 
      <P class=style1>You may encounter situations where you can't get your work 
      done, apparently because of some strange behavior you think may be due to 
      Polaris. Since you're using the Beta release, you may well be right. You 
      may also be wrong. It could be a problem with Windows, or <B>it could be 
      that a virus has attacked the application and is struggling to get out to 
      attack you</B>, which has happened in our existing pilot program with the 
      Alpha release. A virus not detected by Symantec AntiVirus corrupted a Pet, 
      but could not corrupt the system. 
      <P class=style1>It is possible to open the application the unsafe way, but 
      before you go to this extreme, start the Polarizer and Polarize the 
      application again under a new Petname. If the new Pet has the same 
      behavior on a different file, it is probably not a virus. (The virus 
      should be trapped in the original Pet). If the new Pet doesn't work 
      either, you can see if it is a Polaris problem by opening the program the 
      unsafe way. If you're opening the program directly, simply double click on 
      the shortcut for the unsafe application (Found under <B>All Programs</B> 
      under the <B>Start</B> button). If you're opening the program by double 
      clicking on the icon for a file, then right click the document icon and 
      select <B>Open</B> instead of the <B>OpenSafe</B> default. At this point 
      you'll be as vulnerable as you were before you installed Polaris. When you 
      find out that the problem isn't related to Polaris, you can go back to 
      using the Pet. </P>

      <H3 class=style1><A name=diff>Differences from an Unsafe Desktop</A></H3>
      <P class=style1>We have worked hard to make using Polaris identical to 
      using an unsafe Windows XP environment. We haven't completely succeeded, 
      but we've come close. There are no differences for non-Polarized 
      applications. The differences for Polarized applications are: </P>
      <UL class=style1>
        <LI>Some Windows applications lock a file when you edit it. That means 
        that you can only open it for reading while it is locked. Polaris does 
        not lock the original file when you open it in a Pet. That means you can 
        open it for writing outside the Pet. Don't worry. You won't be able to 
        clobber your data. If you try to save a file that's been opened twice, 
        the Pet will tell you to do a <B>SaveAs</B>. There is one exception. If 
        the file is opened simultaneously in more than one Pet, you can get in 
        trouble even if the application normally locks the file. 
        <LI>Drag and drop to running Pets doesn't work. However, you can drag 
        and drop onto the shortcut for a Pet or between windows running in a 
        Pet. 
        <LI>File dialog boxes have buttons along the left side and a pulldown 
        menu at the top. The <B>Desktop</B> entry at the top of the pulldown 
        points to the Pet account, not yours. 
        <LI>Some extra logins are required when running from a Polarized browser 
        unless you've configured your network authentication for those sites. 
        <LI>Polaris doesn't detect non-standard file dialog boxes, such as those 
        produced by some Java applications. You may not want to polarize these 
        programs. 
        <LI>Some extra steps are needed for editable, linked files. For example, 
        you may need to grant read only or read/write permission using the 
        <B>Endowments</B> window. 
        <LI>Some classes of applications, mostly games using advanced graphics, 
        won't run Polarized. 
        <LI>Some ActiveX controls, in particular the one that launches 
        MacroMedia Flash, don't work in polarized Internet Explorer. We are 
        actively investigating this problem. In the interim, if you need Flash, 
        say to watch a baseball game on MLB.com, use Firefox or your unpolarized 
        Internet Explorer. 
        <LI>You won't be able to open files using the application's list of 
        recently used files, either from the File menu or from the task pane. 
        That's because Polaris can't tell if it's you asking or a virus running 
        in the Pet. Instead, use <B>My Recent Documents</B> from the 
        <B>Start</B> menu. <EM>NB: We have a partial solution to this problem. 
        Let us know if this feature is very important to you.</EM> </LI></UL>
      <P class=style1>Other that this relatively short list, everything should 
      work the way it always has, except that you don't have to worry about 
      viruses. In fact, in some ways Polaris makes your machine easier to use. 
      </P>
      <UL class=style1>
        <LI>You can configure your settings to reduce the number of security 
        related dialog boxes presented to you. 
        <LI>You can safely use functions that are too dangerous in a non-Polaris 
        machine, such as macros, web scripting, and launching email attachments. 

        <LI>You can move or rename a file while you are editing it. </LI></UL>

      application is not running Polarized, the <B>&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;</B> is 
      absent. If you don't see this prefix on your Pets, it means you have to 
      restart your PowerWindow. Since the PowerWindow doesn't reconnect to Pets 
      that were running when it crashed, you should close any running Pets 
      first. Note that we have not observed any crashes of the PowerWindow in

      applications</A></H3>
      <P class=style1>This section contains instructions that are specific to 
      individual applications. </P>
      <H4 class=style1><A name=adobe>Adobe Reader:</A></H4>
      <P class=style1>By default, all PDF documents open in the same running 
      instance of the Reader, even if they're opened by different users. That's 
      pretty bizarre, but most personal computers only have one user, so you 
      never notice it. Even more surprising is the behavior when you have 
      previously read a PDF in your browser. Adobe Reader uses that instance 
      even if you open the file from your Desktop. 
      <P class=style1>The bad part is that this behavior can prevent you from 
      using your Acrobat Pet. Say that you've opened a PDF document that you 
      wrote. You know that's safe, so you opened it in your account. Next you 
      open a PDF email attachment. That might not be safe. Since you're a savvy 
      Polaris user, you'd like that document to open in a Pet. Adobe Reader 
      doesn't want to do that. The Pet process starts, sees that there is a 
      process running Reader, and sends a Windows message to that process to 
      open the file. That message doesn't get through. That's a GOOD THING. 
      Allowing such Windows messages from the Pet to your account would let a 
      virus do anything you can do. Too bad for you. The document never opens. 
      <P class=style1>Fortunately, there's an undocumented flag for Adobe 
      Reader, <B>/n</B>, that tells the launcher to use a new instance each time 
      Reader is run. To change this behavior, 
      <UL class=style1>
        <LI>Select <B>Folder Options</B> from the <B>Control Panel</B>. 
        <LI>Select <B>File Types</B> and highlight <B>PDF</B>. 
        <LI>Select <B>Advanced</B> and highlight <B>Open</B>. 
        <LI>Change the <B>"Application used to perform action:"</B> by replacing 
        <B>"%1"</B> with <B>/n "%1"</B>. 
        <LI>Click <B>OK</B> twice. </LI></UL><SPAN class=style1>These arguments 
      are inserted automatically if you use the entry in the <B>Known Pets</B> 
      list. Adding this option to the <B>Open</B> command lets you run an unsafe 
      Reader even if you have a safe Pet running. </SPAN>
      <P class=style1>This behavior also causes problems if you open PDFs by 
      clicking on links in your browser. By default, Adobe Reader runs in the 
      browser process, and the file is rendered in the browser window. We 
      haven't figured out how to attach the <B>/n</B> option to the command, so 
      bad things happen. Fortunately, you can configure Adobe Reader to open in 
      a separate process. 
      <UL class=style1>
        <LI>Open <B>Adobe Reader</B> from the <B>Start</B> menu. 
        <LI>Select <B>Edit</B> and <B>Preferences</B>. 
        <LI>Select <B>Internet</B> from the list of <B>Categories</B>. 
        <LI>Uncheck the box labeled <B>Open PDF in browser window</B>. 
        <LI>Click <B>OK</B> and close Adobe Reader. </LI></UL><SPAN 
      class=style1>Now, when you click on a link in your browser to open a PDF, 
      you'll get a new window containing the document. If the document doesn't 
      open, and you're using Firefox, then you probably have Adobe Reader 
      running. If there are no visible windows for Reader, you may have to kill 
      the process <B>AcroRd32.exe</B> from the <B>Task Manager</B>. 
      <H4 class=style1>Blowfish:</H4><SPAN class=style1>Blowfish is an open 
      source implementation of Bruce Schneier's Blowfish encryption algorithm. 
      Unlike many applications, Blowfish needs read/write access to the folder 
      containing its executable. Check the appropriate box under the 
      <B>Endowments</B> options. </SPAN>
      <H4 class=style1>Browsers:</H4>
      <P class=style1>Should your browser Pet get corrupted by a malicious web 
      site, you can recover by simply repolarizing. Sometimes you can only 
      recover by repolarizing from scratch. That means you'll lose any bookmarks 
      you've set only in the browser Pet. 
      <P class=style1>The simple answer would seem to be sharing the bookmarks 
      with your unpolarized browser. That's not wise. Surprisingly, there are 
      <EM>dangerous</EM> bookmarks. Some malicious sites install them in your 
      list of bookmarks. That means it isn't safe to share bookmarks between 
      polarized and unpolarized versions of your browser. Instead, we recommend 
      setting bookmarks in your unpolarized browser for only trusted sites. 
      <P class=style1>One upshot of not sharing bookmarks is that you'll need to 
      save the bookmarks in your Pet. When updating your bookmarks, you should 
      export them to a convenient place, such as your Desktop. Then, should you 
      have to repolarize from scratch, you can just import them. You should do 
      virus and spyware scans on the file first, though, in case it has one of 
      those bad bookmarks. You should NEVER copy your Pet's bookmarks to your 
      unpolarized browser. Copy individual bookmarks, instead. 
      <H4 class=style1>Internet Explorer (and perhaps other browsers):</H4><SPAN 
      class=style1>Your browser can use your digital certificates. 
      Unfortunately, this Beta release does not copy them for you when you

      export your certificates and import them to each browser Pet. <EM>NB: We 
      are unable to add certificates to your personal set. We believe that 
      happens because the browser is not running with the identity in your 
      certificate, but we're not sure.</EM> 
      <H4 class=style1>Microsoft Office Suite:</H4><SPAN class=style1>Microsoft 
      invested considerable time and money developing an extremely powerful 
      macro language. Unfortunately, attackers can use the power of these macros 
      to damage your machine or steal your secrets. Many installations protect 
      you by setting the security level to keep macros from running. Since 
      you're using Polaris, you're far less vulnerable. In order to run macros, 
      open the polarized version of the application, select 
      <B>Tools/Macro/Security</B> and click the radio button for <B>Low</B>. The

      <H4 class=style1>Outlook:</H4>
      <P class=style1>If you're like most users, you can't do your job without 
      reliable access to your email. That's why most users don't Polarize 
      Outlook. However, if you're brave and paranoid, you may want to. It's not 
      a bad idea. Some viruses launch even if you preview an email. Since your 
      email is so important, you'll probably want to be able to switch back to 
      the unpolarized version if something goes wrong. So, before you polarize 
      Outlook you should record the Outlook settings you are using. 
      Unfortunately, you can only have one instance of Outlook running at a 
      time. That means you'll have to copy your settings manually in order to 
      set up your Outlook Pet. 
      <P class=style1>Select <B>E-mail Accounts</B> from the <B>Tools</B> menu

      click it, since it makes switching between the Polarized and unpolarized 
      Outlooks easier. Finally, click on <B>More Settings ...</B> and make a

      <P class=style1>Polarize Outlook. Make sure that you've selected it as

      want to have to type your login password every time you start your Outlook 
      Pet, add the Exchange server to the list of server sites to automatically 
      authenticate. The first time you open the Outlook Pet, you'll be taken to 
      the <B>E-mail Accounts</B> window. Simply step through the various windows 
      and tabs making sure your settings match those of your unpolarized 
      Outlook. The most important one is the <B>Offline Folder File Settings 
      ...</B> under the <B>Advanced</B> tab. You'll see the path to the cache 
      file. Replace the Pet's user name in that path with yours. If you do,

      unpolarized Outlook and your Outlook Pet.

      about them. 
      <H4 class=style1>Slow Start-up</H4>
      <P class=style1>Your Pet will take a few additional secconds to start the 
      first time you use a Pet after a reboot or when the Pet hasn't been used 
      for a long time. Don't panic. Windows has to load the Pet's account 
      information into the registry. Microsoft didn't optimize that path because 
      they assumed it would only be needed at login. Once the registry 
      information is loaded, your application will start without any additional 
      delay. We have seen cases where the start-up takes 30 seconds or so. 
      Usually that's because a disk intensive application, such as a virus scan, 
      is running. Be patient. After the first time, your Pet will launch 
      normally. 
      <H4 class=style1>Failure to start</H4>
      <P class=style1>Nothing may happen when you try to launch a pet. The most 
      common cause is that the PowerWindow isn't running. If it is running, try 
      again. That sometimes works. If trying again doesn't work, the PowerWindow 
      may be stuck. Close all Pets, restart the PowerWindow, and try again. 
      <P class=style1>Firefox and Adobe Reader may fail to start for a different 
      reason. They try to use a running instance, even if that instance is 
      running in a different user account. Your Firefox Pet won't open if you 
      have Firefox running in your account. Firefox won't open in your account 
      if you have a Firefox Pet running. If Adobe Reader is running in your 
      account, it won't open a PDF from Firefox. There will also be problems

      <H4 class=style1>Application doesn't respond after file operation</H4>
      <P class=style1>There are times when your application will stop responding 
      after a file operation, such as <B>Open</B> or <B>Save As</B>. It may be 
      that your file dialog box is under some other window or that it's on an 
      alternate screen if you use more than one monitor. Sometimes clicking on 
      the icon for your pet in the task bar makes the dialog box visible. If 
      that doesn't work, you can minimize windows to see if the dialog box is 
      under one of them. If that doesn't work, simply hitting <B>ESC</B> will 
      clear up the problem. You can then try opening the file dialog box 
      again.</P>
      <H4 class=style1>Lost Changes to a File</H4>
      <P class=style1>If something goes wrong, the updates you're making in the 
      Pet may not appear in the file you opened. The most common reason is that 
      you closed the PowerWindow while a Pet was open. If you suspect that may 
      have happened, look in the folder <B>PolarisRecover</B> on your Desktop. 
      Any changes you made up to the last Save or SaveAs will be in the file in 
      that folder. If there's no file, then the all the changes up to your last 
      Save or SaveAs are reflected in the orginal file. Perhaps you should 
      consider saving more frequently. 
      <H4 class=style1>Blue Screen of Death</H4>
      <P class=style1>The only reports we have of this behavior is when coming 
      out of <B>Suspend</B> mode on a machine with VMWare installed. The problem 
      occurs even when no virtual machine is running. Uninstalling VMWare 
      appears to fix the problem. An alternative is to avoid suspending your 
      machine by hibernating or shutting down. 
      <H4 class=style1>Pets Disappear</H4>
      <P class=style1>One user reported that Pets disappeared seemingly at 
      random times. We identified the problem as being due to the desktop 
      management software being used. The tool gives the user multiple virtual 
      desktops. However, since the tool runs on early versions of Windows, it 
      doesn't use the Windows Desktop introduced in Windows 2000. Instead, it 
      opens and closes windows to give the appearance of separate desktops. The 
      problem is that Polaris assumes a process running in a Pet that has no 
      visible windows has been started by a virus and kills it. The solution is 
      to configure your desktop management software so that your Pets appear on 
      all virtual desktops. Alternatively, you can tell Polaris not to close the 
      Pet when no windows are visible by setting the endowment when you 
      Polarize. Don't forget that every file you open is available to the Pet 
      until you tell Polaris to close it. 
      <H4 class=style1>File Dialog Box Pulldown Points to Wrong Place</H4>
      <P class=style1>File dialog boxes have buttons along the left side and a 
      pulldown menu at the top. The <B>Desktop</B> entry at the top of the 
      pulldown points to the Pet account, not yours. You can navigate to your 
      own area by using the pulldown to navigate to <B>c:\Documents and 
      Settings\alice</B>, if your userid is <B>alice</B>. You'll see entries for 
      <B>Desktop</B> and <B>alice's Documents</B>. Alternatively, you can use 
      the buttons on the left. They point to your folders, not the Pet's. 
      <H4 class=style1>Text in File Dialog Box is Offset</H4>
      <P class=style1>If you can't see the all fields in the PowerWindow's file 
      dialog box, or the window is all gray, you can simply type the fully 
      qualified pathname of the file. Otherwise, just close the dialog box and 
      try again. The offset occurs rarely, so you should be fine after one more 
      try. 
      <H4 class=style1>Application Doesn't Use Standard File Dialog</H4>
      <P class=style1>Some applications, particularly those ported from Unix or 
      that you've written yourself, don't use standard file dialog boxes. A 
      common example is Java applications written with the Swing library, those 
      with the funny looking flat buttons. You won't be able to open any files 
      other than at launch time because the Pet won't have the permission to 
      read them. If you do need access, you can manually copy the file or files 
      to the Pet account's area. However, you won't have synchronizers for these 
      files. Also, these files will be deleted shortly after the last instance 
      of the Pet is closed. 
      <H4 class=style1>Failure to open file</H4>
      <P class=style1>The file you designated doesn't open. Trying again almost

      <H4 class=style1>Inability to print</H4>
      <P class=style1>Some enterprises use authenticating network print servers,

      Authentication on the Polarizer or bypass the print server. To set up a

      <P class=style1>By default, WinZip tries to open in a currently open 
      WinZip window. If WinZip was opened in a Pet, opening another zip file 
      with your permissions will fail. The problem is that the unconfined WinZip 
      sees the existing window and tries to use it. Unbeknownst to WinZip, that 
      window is running in a Pet and doesn't have permission to read the zip

      opened by WinZip not running in that Pet. 
      <P class=style1>There's another problem if WinZip opens in a Pet. Since 
      WinZip uses non-standard dialog boxes, you won't be able to extract files

      open the zip file with WinZip running with your permissions. 
      Alternatively, you can extract the files to a folder in the Pet account,

      <P class=style1>The most important limitation of Polaris is that it only

      or even Windows 2000. However, there are minor differences that cause 
      problems. Try Polaris at your own risk on other versions of Windows. 
      <P class=style1>There are a number of applications that you should not 
      Polarize because they don't work when confined. These are the ones we know

        Polarized, we recommend against running Cygwin on a Polarized machine. 
        In particular, using the Cygwin <B>cp</B> command leads to conflict with

      <H3 class=style1><A name=upgrading>Upgrading from the Alpha</A></H3>
      <P class=style1>The Alpha version of Polaris has proven to be surprisingly 
      stable and effective at blocking the current crop of viruses. 
      Unfortunately, the Alpha version is vulnerable to a very simple attack 
      that isn't necessary if people aren't using Polaris. Once Polaris is in 
      widespread use, we can expect to see this attack appear. Moving to the 
      Polaris Beta will protect you. 
      <P class=style1>On Windows, any process can send a Windows message to any 
      other window on the desktop. These messages tell the recipient process to 
      do such things as type characters, open files, and run commands. Microsoft 
      states that all programs running on a desktop are assumed to have the same 
      privileges. That's true on a standard desktop, but not with Polaris. 
      Hence, a virus running in a program on a standard desktop can do anything 
      the user can do, up to and including erasing all the user's files. A virus 
      running in a Pet can't. However, it can send a Windows message to the 
      <B>Start</B> button telling it to select <B>Run</B> and execute <B>erase 
      *.*</B>. 
      <P class=style1>The Polaris Beta adds an additional restriction to 
      programs running in Pets. They can only send Windows messages to other 
      windows associated with that same Pet. A virus running in a Pet can't even 
      find out that the <B>Start</B> button exists. 
      <P class=style1>Unfortunately, upgrading to the Beta isn't simple because 
      the Alpha doesn't have an <B>Uninstall</B> utility. That means a lot of 
      manual work is required. If you're about to get a new machine, you might 
      want to keep the Alpha release on your current machine and install the 
      Beta on the new one. On the other hand, having the Alpha version on your 
      machine won't interfere with your use of the Beta. After glancing through 
      the instructions for removing the Alpha, you might just decide to leave it 
      installed. 
      <P class=style1>If you want to leave the Alpha on your machine, then 
      follow the first five steps. If you want to remove all vestiges of the 
      Alpha, then do all of them. Read the instructions carefully. Because of 
      the way the browser wraps text at the end of the line, some filenames end 
      up split between two lines. Make sure you don't delete a folder when you 
      should have deleted a single file.
