Polaris is a Microsoft Windows system for running application software with limited authority.
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_Polaris_%28computer_security%29

*** The code here is a proof of concept. It was never intended to be more than
a research prototype built to show that we could run applications with
reduced authority with only minimal impact on the user experience. The
code has to be reviewed, tested and probably rewritten before being
deployed to a wider user base. That being said, as many as 100 users have
run a wide variety of applications under Polaris, and several have
reported being saved from virus attacks. ***
